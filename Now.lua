  BiS Healing :: Now.lua - "BiS> now", the window of buttons that matter right now.

  ARN'S DESIGN (1 Oct 2026), in his words: a breakaway window that starts with the help button and
  grows as we find more things worth a button. Each one is invisible until it is relevant - "alpha
  zero as you get lower in health it gets less opaque and more red at very low health" - and the
  order of them LEARNS: "if a party member is feared after combat the button moves up one space...
  if 2 combats happen and people are poison more often the poison cleanse totem moves up more
  spaces than the fear because people are getting feared more."

  THIS FILE IS THE ORDER ONLY. No frames, no textures, no secrets: it answers "which buttons, in
  what order" and nothing else. That is deliberate - the two questions that decide how the window
  LOOKS (will the client pick a brightness from secret health, can we see who is feared) are still
  being measured, and the order does not depend on either. A button fed by plain data and a button
  fed by a curve queue up the same way.

  WHY A SWAP AND NOT A SCOREBOARD. "Moves up one space" is an algorithm, not just a phrase: swap a
  button with the one above it each time its situation happens, and frequency sorts itself out -
  poison in two fights passes fear in one, with no tally to keep, no weights to tune and no way for
  one wild night to bury something for a week. It is also the only shape that can be WRITTEN DOWN
  cheaply, which matters more here than it would anywhere else (see the macro, below).

  AFTER THE FIGHT, AND THAT IS NOT A COMPROMISE. Moving a secure button is refused in combat, the
  same rule that makes the target cell queue its changes. So the only legal moment to reorder is
  PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED - which is exactly when Arn asked for it. The client and the design agree.

  WHAT IS KEPT: the ORDER, not the counts. SavedVariables never come back on this client, so
  anything worth keeping rides in the player's own macro - and there is no room there for a tally
  per button. There does not need to be: the order IS the memory. One row, one digit per button
  (see FK, row "R"), and a hundred fights of learning survives in six characters.

--- EVERY BUTTON THAT CAN LIVE HERE, in a fixed order with fixed ids.
---
--- `id` is what gets written into the macro, so it is a promise: an id never changes meaning and a
--- retired button's id is never reused. A macro written today must still mean the same thing to a
--- version that has gained three more buttons, and the only way to keep that is to never shuffle
--- these numbers. New buttons go on the END.
---
--- `pinned` holds a button still. The help button is yours and always first: a panic button that
--- moves is a panic button you have to look for, which defeats the whole point of it.
---
--- `needs` is the spell this character must actually have trained, asked of the spellbook rather
--- than assumed - the lesson of Earth Shield and Water Shield in one evening. nil means anyone.

  never touched again - a secure button cannot be changed mid-fight, and none of
  these needs to be. The only thing that moves while you are fighting is COLOUR,
